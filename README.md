 # Project Description
This project is developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab.
It is a Python-based stock management website that demonstrates the practical
implementation of core data structures and algorithms in backend logic.

The system allows users to add, search, sort, and manage stock data efficiently.

## Data Structures Used
 Binary Search Tree (BST)  
  Used to store stock records in a structured and ordered manner.

   Stack  
  Used to implement undo functionality for add and delete operations.
## Algorithms Implemented
- Merge Sort  
  Used to sort all stock records stored in the Binary Search Tree.

- Linear Search  
  Used to search stock records based on user input.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Backend)
- HTML and CSS (Frontend)

## Functionality Overview
- New stocks are inserted into a Binary Search Tree
- Stocks are searched using Linear Search
- Stock records are sorted using Merge Sort
- Stack is used to undo the last add or delete operation
- Fully functional web-based interface for user interaction
